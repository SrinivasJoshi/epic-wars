# Epic Wars

## Overview

Our project for the hackathon is a card game that utilizes Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and is built on the Oasis Sapphire Testnet. This innovative game combines blockchain technology with React, React Router DOM for routing, and WebSocket (Sockets) for real-time game logic communication. To ensure data security, we've integrated this game with Oasis private blockchain, which restricts access to NFT properties stored on the blockchain.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Dynamic user interface.
- **React Router DOM**: Navigation.
- **WebSocket (Sockets)**: Real-time communication.
- **Express Server**: Backend.
- **Oasis Sapphire Testnet**: Secure blockchain for NFTs.

## Challenges

- Blockchain Integration
- Real-time Communication

## Things to Note

- **Blockchain Commented Code**: In the smart contract, there may be commented code referencing msg.sender. This is due to issues with accessing structs using providers and access control on the blockchain.

- **Server Status** : Please be aware that the server might occasionally be offline. If this happens, kindly wait for a while before continuing.
